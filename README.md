## About

One of the first programs I ever built.

A Python3 console version of the popular Mastermind game.

# Installation

Simply `git clone` this repository,

    git clone https://github.com/PScoriae/MastermindPy

or copy the code in [`main.py`](https://github.com/PScoriae/MastermindPy/blob/main/main.py) into a `.py` file onto your system.

# Running the Program

First, open a terminal in the project's root directory. Then, `cd` into the `src` folder like so:

    cd src

Finally, run the following command:

    python3 main.py
